# 2023 Phase 2

Welcome to Phase 2 of the 2023 MSA programme! This year, Phase 2 consists of two components:

1. Technical
    - This repository represents the entire technical component of Phase 2, which will assess your technical skills
    - Complete this component individually using Phase 1 knowledge + the resources that the MSA team has provided in the folder for each stream

2. Non-Technical
    - The non-technical component will consist of events such as soft-skills and presentation workshops with MSA team members and/or Microsoft employees + interviews with employers, which will improve and assess your non-technical skills
    - The events above will take place between mid-August and mid-September with placements being confirmed by mid-September, more details will be announced via our [socials](https://linktr.ee/msanz) and via email to all participating students
    - Some events may be invite-only, in which case invitations will be sent to the highest ranked students across Phase 1 and Phase 2 submissions after they have been marked

The expected workload for Phase 2 of each stream is 3-4 hours per week and builds upon the knowledge from Phase 1 of each stream. Furthermore, placements will be either in Software Development or Data Science, not both. As such, we recommend that you follow one stream only in order to manage your time effectively and build your knowledge and skills within one stream as much as you can in order to stand out to employers.

## Microsoft Azure Sign-Up Instructions

Before starting Phase 2, you will need to sign up for an Azure for Students subscription using your institution email. This will give you $100 credit and free services to use within 12 months of signing up. After you use your credit, wait until the 12 months are over and sign up again if youâ€™re still a student. You'll get $100 credit and free services just like before.

If you do not have an Azure account using your institution email:
1. Go to [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students) and click **Start for free**
2. Sign in using your institution email
    - If you are based at the University of Auckland, your university email is already associated with a Microsoft account so do not create a new account using your university email, simply sign in.
    - If you are based at a different institution, check whether your institution has already provided you with a Microsoft account by trying to sign in first (if that doesn't work, create a new account using your institution email)
2. Follow the prompts to verify your academic status

If you already have an Azure account using your institution email:
1. Sign in to [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students)
2. You will most likely be shown how much credit you have remaining and when your Azure for Students subscription expires if it has not expired yet, or prompted to renew if it has expired.

After you have completed the steps above, you should be directed to the [Education page of the Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/?Microsoft_Azure_Education_correlationId=e940c73ae3ec44b1852cb836987cef3e#view/Microsoft_Azure_Education/EducationMenuBlade/~/overview) - this is where you can see how much credit you have remaining, how many days until your Azure for Students subscription expires, and other helpful resources. Please see [the FAQs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/education-hub/azure-dev-tools-teaching/program-faq#azure-for-students) regarding eligibility requirements and more useful information about Azure for Students.

Keep an eye on your Azure spending! For all of the tasks in this part, you will not be charged anything or any charges you do incur will come from your $100 credit because we have designed this part to only use services available within Azure for Students (which are either always free or cost some amount to use that will be taken from your credit). 

- If you only use the services within Azure for Students, it will be extremely difficult for you to use up the entire $100 credit, but if your usage results in your credit being depleted to $0, you won't be able to get more credit until your Azure for Students subscription expires, and you'll have to move to [pay as you go](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/free/students/?WT.mc_id=academic-9938-cxa).

- MSA is not responsible for and will not refund or cancel any costs you personally incur due to services that you use.
