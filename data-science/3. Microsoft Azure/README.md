# Part 3 - Microsoft Azure

Welcome to the third and final part of Phase 2 Data Science! This part will involve you doing (almost) everything you've done in the first two parts in the cloud! 

Microsoft's cloud computing platform is called Azure and this part will specifically focus on Azure Machine Learning, a service within Azure that allows you to do everything from running Jupyter notebooks and training machine learning models in the cloud to logging evaluation metrics across multiple iterations of model development and deploying models from within the Azure Portal (i.e. the website you'll use to access Azure from your web browser) or from your own code.

We hope you find that doing data science in the cloud makes several things easier and faster to accomplish while unlocking some useful features that can help you as a data scientist deliver more value in less time! The features within Azure Machine Learning that this part will focus on are:

- **Notebooks** for saving and executing Jupyter notebooks
- **AutoML** to automatically train and tune models
- **Runs** to track metrics like precision, recall, ROC, AUC etc.
- **Model deployment** using Docker containers from both the Azure Portal and from your IDE into Azure
